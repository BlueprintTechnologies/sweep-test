# Sweep AI Test Repo
A test of [Sweep AI](https://github.com/sweepai/sweep).

## What Am I Looking At?
Sweep AI considers itself "an AI junior developer that transforms bug reports & feature requests into code changes." They even created a resume for the AI available at https://docs.sweep.dev/resume.pdf.

We started by creating a simple webpage for a fictional company that installs jet engines in cars. We added the web page code to this repo (jetcar-innovations-main-website.html).

After configuring Sweep for this particular repo, we created an issue and called out Sweep specifically - https://github.com/BlueprintTechnologies/sweep-test/issues/1. 

Take a look at that issue and view how Sweep responds. It goes through the change planning, the actual coding, and its own code review! Then submits the pull request.
